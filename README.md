## Usage 
Using the **Employee Task Planner** only takes a few steps and it is easy to do.

First of all, get the most important tasks of your day to day workflow ready so they can be inputed into the application.

- Input into each hour of the application the corresponding tasks needed to be done before the end of that hour.
- Once each hour is filled in with the appropriate tasks, hit the ***suitcase*** icon.
- Everytime you press the ***suitcase*** icon, the entire textfield for that hour will be re-saved into local storage. 
- **Don't forget to save!**

There is a feature in the application to help visualize your tasks in a more interactive way.

**The Current Hour**
Each row will have a special color associated to it that corresponds to its state based on the hour of the day.
1. **The Past**
    - Once the hour is over, the corresponding row in the application will be highligted a gray color. 
    - If it is in gray, the task should have been completed by now
2. **The Present**
    - If it is the current hour of the day, the row will be highlighted in blue. 
    - This is the color you want to focus on if you are looking for what needs to be finished now.
3. **The Future**
    - Rows associated with future hours will be highligted in purple.
    - These are the tasks you still have time to do and will turn blue once the hour comes when they are due.
